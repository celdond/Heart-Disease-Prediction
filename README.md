# Heart-Disease-Prediction
A Neural Network model to predict heart disease in patients based on their status and medical history.

## Overview

There are statistics in the United States that 1 in every 5 deaths are due to heart disease.
The best outcomes to any disease are to know ahead of time if a patient is at risk of heart disease and to make the changes necessary to avoid complications.

To accomplish this, a neural network machine learning model can be deployed to give a second opinion on the current health status of patients by identifying 
potential patterns within patients with heart disease.

## Use and Install

This project was coded on a local machine using Python 3.10.7 and the packages described in the included requirements.txt. To mimic this environment, simply clone said repository on a local machine and run the following python command in your desired location.

pip install -r requirements.txt

This project used a virtual environment.

As a Jupyter Notebook, web applications such as Google Colab will be a servicable alternative, and the project should work fine as long as the data is loaded in appropriately.

The data used for the project is located here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+disease

The contents need simply be unzipped and placed into a /data folder.
